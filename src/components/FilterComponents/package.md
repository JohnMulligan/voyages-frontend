# Filter Component Factories

Filter component factories generate ui elements that update the Redux store, which in turn is used by all the presentation components to show the search results in their own way.

Which filter component factory is generated is determined by the *filter component factory controller* WHERE DOES THIS HAPPEN?. We currently have 3 different filter component types, which are triggered by different variable data types:

* RangeSlider for numeric fields
* AutoComplete for text fields
* GeoTreeSelect for places

The properties that each filter component factory receives are

	1. endpoint
	1. variable name
	1. label
	1. filter object state
	1. anything else?

The filter component that has been generated updates the Redux store to maintain the active variable filters that the user has selected.

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete is a special case. It remains in constant contact with its own, special sub-endpoint on the API in order to assist the user in quickly narrowing down their search. RangeSlider and TreeSelect only hit the API once, in order to populate the available choices.

When these filter components are interacted with by the user, the selected values are pushed to the Redux store as k/v pairs, with the variable name being the key and the selected values being the values.

## GeoTreeSelect

GeoTreeSelect is also a special case, but we are considering generalizing this behavior to the other two search filter components. When GeoTreeSelect asks the server for the tree, it also passes the filter object, meaning that as other filters are applied, the number of displayed options shrinks down accordingly.
